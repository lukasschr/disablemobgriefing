DISABLE MOB GRIEFING
====================

A lightweight Fabric mod that allows you to selectively disable specific types of mob griefing using custom gamerules.  
Currently, the following mob behaviors can be disabled: **Creeper griefing** and **Enderman block manipulation**.

## Features

This mod introduces two new gamerules:

- `/gamerule disableCreeperGriefing true`  
  Prevents Creepers from destroying blocks when they explode. Damage to entities (players, mobs, etc.) remains unaffected.

- `/gamerule disableEndermanGriefing true`  
  Prevents Endermen from picking up or placing blocks in the world.


## Notes

- The mod is designed primarily for **server-side use**.
- No additional mods are required.
